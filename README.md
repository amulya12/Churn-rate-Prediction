# Churn-rate-Prediction
The objective of the project is to use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the attrition of future customers so that it would be helpful to the companies to find the customers who are more likely to unsubscribe from a service that helps the company to retain them rather than losing.

Scope:
● To infer the factors which influence the customers most.
● Usage of Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, etc., to predict the churn of the future customers
● Models built using train datasets are tested through the test dataset. Accuracy and
error rate are used to understand how these models are behaving for the test
dataset.
● So that it would be helpful to the companies to improve their services and retain
the original customers and attract the original customers.
